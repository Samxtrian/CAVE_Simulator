The CAVE Simulator is a VR application made with Unity for mobile VR devices (like the Oculus Quest) that uses stereoscopic cubemaps, offcenter projection, and offscreen rendering to simulate a CAVE VR Display system in Virtual Reality. To learn more about CAVE you can visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment

If you wish to run the simulator, you will have to enable developer permissions on your oculus headset and sideload the apk to it following the instructions at https://headjack.io/knowledge-base/how-to-easily-sideload-a-vr-app-to-oculus-quest-2/

If you wish to look at just the code involved in making the simulator, you can just open the scripts folder and look at the relevant files,
however if you want to build and test the project in Unity then you will have to dowload and extract the given zip file instead 

Made using: OpenGL, Unity, CSharp, and ShaderLabs. Compressed on Github using Git LFS
